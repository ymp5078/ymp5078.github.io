## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Informatics at the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu) at The Pennsylvania State University, under the supervision of [Prof. James Z. Wang](https://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml). My research focuses on **Computer Vision** and **Multi-Modality Learning** with applications in healthcare, emotion understanding, and AI-assisted clinical tools. I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon during the summer of 2024 under the guidance of Yelin Kim, Hongda Mao, and Cici Chen, focusing on Last Mile applications.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science (Summa Cum Laude), as well as B.S. degrees in Mathematics and Statistics (both Magna Cum Laude), all from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu), class of 2021. My skills include developing machine learning algorithms and applying them in areas such as healthcare and medical imaging.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** robustness improvement, video understanding, medical image analysis
- **Multi-Modality Learning:** cross-modal learning, vision-language model, generative model
